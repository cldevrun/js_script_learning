# js_script_learning
A simple repo to showcase some of my journey into learning javascript,
one of the key languages used in web development alongside html & css.
This is an attempt of mine to build an interactive version of the 
classic rock, paper, scissors game. A live interaction can be seen [here](https://cldevrun.github.io/js_script_learning/).
